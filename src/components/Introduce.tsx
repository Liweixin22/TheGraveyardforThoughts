      <Paragraph>
        Hi folks, welcome to the graveyard for thoughts.<br />
        This is a place where I bury my thoughts, ideas, and mindsets that I have learned from books, podcasts, and other sources.<br />
        Maybe no one else will read this,<br />
        but maybe someday you will pass by the graveyard<br />
        and find something useful for you.<br />
        And maybe, in the cruellest April, the lilacs will bloom out of that dead land.<br />
      </Paragraph>
    </div>
