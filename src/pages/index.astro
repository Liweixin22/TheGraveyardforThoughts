		<p> Hi folks, welcome to the graveyard for thoughts.<br> 
		    This is a place where I bury my thoughts, ideas, and mindsets that I have learned from books, podcasts, and other sources.<br>
		    Maybe no one else will read this.<br>
		    but maybe someday you will pass by the graveyard<br>
			and find something useful for you.<br>
		    And maybe, in the cruellest April, the lilacs will bloom out of that dead land.<br>
		</p>
